        <p id='aboutp'>
          My name is Charles Manna (you can call me CJ if you pay me a dollar) and I'm an intended computer science major at UC Berkeley. I come from Irvine, California and my favorite food is galbi jjim. If I had a superpower, it would be the ability to stop time so I could erase the cognitive dissonance I have between wanting to be a morning person and also loving to sleep in. My hobbies include physics, coding, painting (no one said you have to be good at your hobbies) and sleeping on my
          dog (he hates me). I want to learn French, Italian, Korean, and Chinese at some point in no particular order. I love watching movies, my favorite is Pan's Labyrinth, and I'm in the middle of watching Naruto for the first time right now (no spoilers please). This is not professional at all, but that's a little about me. Feel free to check out my social media below, I'd love to meet you!
